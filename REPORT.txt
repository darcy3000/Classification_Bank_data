We have dropped all the categorical values as they are not numeric and cannot be use in calculating gradient.
Accuracy on test data is roughly 80% after 4000 epochs.Test data size is 30%
Answers
A)All the features which have numeric entries are taking while creating the model because we can calculate gradient of floaing values not strings
B)Accuracy is ~80%
C)Activation function used is sigmoid because it differentiable everywhere
D)I have used 4 hidden layers and 100 units per layer.I have reached this number after experimenting and to avoid overfitting
